  caveats <<~EOS
    Bobrwm needs Accessibility access to manage windows. Launch it once, then
    grant it in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.

    To run it at login, set `.start_at_login = true` in
    ~/.config/bobrwm/config.zon.

    Upgrading from the old formula? Remove it so the two do not both own
    `bobrwm` on your PATH:
      brew uninstall --formula bobrwm
